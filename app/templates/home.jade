        | You're probably used to equations of unknown variables like $ 5(t-.5)(t-1)(t-2)^2 = 0,$ where 'solving' means finding a number, $t$.

        | A differential equation is a statement about the derivative of an unknown  <em>function</em>, not a number. For example, since the derivative of $\sin(t)$ is $\cos(t)$, $\sin(t)$ is a solution of $$ \dot y = \cos(t).$$ A good way to view derivatives is to draw a triangle. If its hypoteneuse just grazes the function, and its width is $1$, then its height is the derivative (see if you can figure out why).

        | Consider a cart rolling to a stop. It turns out the cart's motion obeys the DE $$ \dot{v} = -k \cdot v, $$ where $v$ is velocity, $\dot{v}$ is the rate-of-change of velocity and $k$ is a 'coefficient of friction.' Basically, how fast the cart slows down ($\dot{v}$) is directly proportional to its velocity ($v$).

        |  The solution is a function $v(t)$ that gives the velocity at $t$. We'll assume the starting velocity is $4$ and $k=1$, so $v(t)$ must solve $\dot{v}= -v$ and $v(0)=4$.
        //- (TOOLTIP The DE implies that if the cart goes twice as fast, it slows down twice as fast. If we solve the DE, we can get a function $v(t)$ that tells the velocity at time $t$.)

        | To find $v(t)$, make and drag points on Plot A. Each point is a time/velocity pair like $\left( t, v \right)$. The program strings those $(t,v)$ together to make a function $v(t)$. You start out with the point $(t=0,v=2)$, since the cart starts rolling with velocity $2$.

        | Every time you place a point, we can store the value $v(t)$ and the slope $\dot {v}(t)$ as a pair $( v, \dot{v})$. Those pairs get plotted on Plot B. If you draw the $v(t)$ correctly, then the $(v, \dot {v})$ points will all wind up on the line $\dot{v} = -v$.
