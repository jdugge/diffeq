					| You're probably used to equations like $$(t-.5)(t-1)= 0,$$ where 'solving' means finding an unknown <em>number</em>. A differential equation (DE), by contrast, is a fact about the derivative of an unknown <em>function</em>. 'Solving' one means finding a function that fits it.
				p
					| To visualize derivatives, we draw a right triangle whose hypoteneuse is tangent to a function. If the triangle's width is $1$, then its <span class='col dv'>height</span> is the derivative.

				p
					| Mousing over the plots to the right, you can see the derivative of <span class='col v'>$\sin(t)$</span> is <span class='col dv'>$\cos(t)$</span>. Thus, $y(t)=\sin(t)$ is a solution to the DE $$ \dot y = \cos(t).$$ 
				p
					| That's a pretty basic DE, though. You could have solved it just by integrating $\cos(t)$. Now let's look at a more complicated one.

					| Consider a cart rolling to a stop. Its motion obeys the DE $$ \dot{v} = -k \cdot v, $$ where $v$ is velocity, $\dot{v}$ is the rate-of-change of velocity and $k$ is a 'coefficient of friction' that depends on how greased the axels are. Basically, the faster the cart goes, the faster it slows down.

					|  The solution to the DE is a function $v(t)$ that tells velocity at time $t$. We'll assume $k=.8$ and that the cart starts rolling at time $t=0$ with initial velocity $2$. Formally, our clues are $\dot{v}= -.8v$ and $v(0)=2$.
				p
					| It turns out the exponential function, $e^{-kt}$, has the convenient properties $$ \begin{align} \frac{d}{dt}e^{-kt}=-ke^{-kt} && e^{-.8\cdot 0}=1.\end{align}$$ Thus, if $v(t)=2e^{-.8t}$, then $\dot{v}=-.8v$ and $v(0)=2$, as required!

					| Here, you'll solve the cart's DE manually by picking a series of $\left( t, v \right)$ pairs, which make up the function $v(t)$. At each point, the derivative is calculated and the corresponding pair $( v, \dot{v})$ shows up on the lower chart. If you draw $v(t)$ correctly, then the $(v, \dot {v})$ points wind up around the line $\dot{v} = -v$. 
				p
					| The first cart below obeys the $v(t)$ function you designed. The second obeys $v(t)=2e^{-.8t}$. If you draw $v(t)$ correctly, both cars move together. Grey lines indicate  locations sampled every half-second, so if the carts move in tandem they'll line up.
