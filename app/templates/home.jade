					| You're probably used to equations of unknown numbers like $ 5(t-.5)(t-1)(t-2)^2 = 0,$ where 'solving' means finding a number, $t$. To solve this, we can plot $5(t-.5)(t-1)(t-2)^2$ as a function <span class='col v'>$y(t)$</span> and look for $t$ where $y(t)=0$, like to the right.

					| A differential equation is a fact about the derivative of an unknown  <em>function</em>, not a number. For example, you know from calc rules that the derivative of <span class='col v'>$\sin(t)$</span> is <span class='col dv'>$\cos(t)$</span>, so $y(t)=\sin(t)$ is a solution of the differential equation $$ \dot y = \cos(t).$$

					| To visualize derivatives, we'll draw a right triangle. If its width is $1$ and hypoteneuse is tangent to $y(t)$ at $t$, then its height is the derivative at $t$.

				| Consider a cart rolling to a stop. It turns out the cart's motion obeys the DE $$ \dot{v} = -k \cdot v, $$ where $v$ is velocity, $\dot{v}$ is the rate-of-change of velocity and $k$ is a 'coefficient of friction.' Basically, how fast the cart slows down ($\dot{v}$) is directly proportional to its velocity ($v$).

				|  The solution is a function $v(t)$ that gives the velocity at $t$. We'll assume the starting velocity is $4$ and $k=1$, so $v(t)$ must solve $\dot{v}= -v$ and $v(0)=4$.

				| Below, click and drag Plot A to make points of time/velocity pair like $\left( t, v \right)$. Together those pairs make up a function $v(t)$. You can't change the point $(t=0,v=4)$, though, since the cart's initial velocity is $4$.

				| For each point, we can store the value $v(t)$ and the derivative $\dot {v}(t)$ as a pair $( v, \dot{v})$. Those pairs get plotted on Plot B. If you draw the $v(t)$ correctly, then the $(v, \dot {v})$ points will all wind up on the line $\dot{v} = -v$.
