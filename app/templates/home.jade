        | Maybe you're used to solving equations like $ t^2 - 2t = 1,$ where 'solving' means finding an unknown <em>number</em>, $t$. On the right, drag $t$ until $t^2 - 2t$ equals $2$.

        | By contrast, a differential equation (DE) has an unknown <em>function</em>. You solve it with a clue about its derivative. A good way to view derivatives is to draw a triangle. If the hypoteneuse just grazes the function, and its width is $1$, then its height is the derivative.

        | Think about a cart rolling to a stop: it slows down quickly when it goes fast, and slowly when it goes slow. The cart turns out to obey the DE $$ \dot{v} = -k \cdot v, $$ where $v$ is velocity, $\dot{v}$ is the rate-of-change of velocity and $k$ is a 'coefficient of friction.' Basically, how fast the cart slows down ($\dot{v}$) is directly proportional to its velocity ($v$)...just like how an ice cube warms up faster than water does.

        |  We'll use this DE to find a function $v(t)$ telling the velocity at time $t$. We'll assume the starting velocity is $4$ and $k=1$, so $v(t)$ must solve $v'= -v$ and $v(0)=4$.
        //- (TOOLTIP The DE implies that if the cart goes twice as fast, it slows down twice as fast. If we solve the DE, we can get a function $v(t)$ that tells the velocity at time $t$.)

        | To find $v(t)$, make and drag points on Plot A. Each point is a time/velocity pair like $\left( t, v \right)$. The program strings those $(t,v)$ together to make a function $v(t)$. You start out with the point $(t=0,v=2)$, since the cart starts rolling with velocity $2$.

        | Every time you place a point, we can store the value $v(t)$ and the slope $v'(t)$ as a pair $( v, v')$. Those pairs get plotted on Plot B. If you draw the $v(t)$ correctly, then the $(v, v')$ points will all wind up on the line $v'= -v$.
