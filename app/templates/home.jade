					| You're probably used to equations like $$(t-.5)(t-1)= 0,$$ where 'solving' means finding an unknown <em>number</em>. A differential equation (DE), by contrast, is a fact about the derivative of an unknown <em>function</em>, and 'solving' one means finding a function that fits.
				p
					| To visualize derivatives, we can draw a right <span class='col tri'>triangle</span> whose hypoteneuse is tangent to a function. If the triangle's width is $1$, then its <span class='col dv'>height</span> is the derivative.
				p
					| Mousing over the plots to the right, you can see the derivative of <span class='col v'>$\sin(t)$</span> is <span class='col dv'>$\cos(t)$</span>. Thus, $y(t)=\sin(t)$ is a solution to $$ \dot y = \cos(t).$$ 
				p
					| That's a pretty basic DE, though. You could have solved it just by integrating $\cos(t)$. Now let's look at a more complicated one.

	//- 				| Consider a cart rolling to a stop. Its motion obeys the DE $$ \dot{v} = -k \cdot v, $$ where $v$ is velocity, $\dot{v}$ is the rate-of-change of velocity and $k$ is a '<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friction#Coefficient_of_friction'>coefficient of friction.</a>' Basically, the faster the cart goes, the faster it slows down.

	//- 				|  The solution is a function $v(t)$ giving velocity at time $t$. Suppose $k=.8$ and that the cart starts rolling at time $t=0$ at velocity $2$. Then we want a $v(5)$ for which $\dot{v}= -.8v$ and $v(0)=2$.
	//- 			p
	//- 				| It turns out the exponential function, $e^{-kt}$, has the properties $$ \begin{align} \frac{d}{dt}e^{-kt}=-ke^{-kt} && e^{-k\cdot 0}=1.\end{align}$$ Thus, if $v(t)=2e^{-.8t}$, then $\dot{v}=-.8v$ and $v(0)=2$. Solved!

					| Here, you'll solve the cart's DE manually by picking a series of $\left( t, v \right)$ pairs, which make up the function $v(t)$. At each point, the derivative $\dot{v}$ is calculated and the corresponding pair $( v, \dot{v})$ shows up on the lower chart. If you try to draw $v(t)=2e^-{.8t}$, then the $(v, \dot {v})$ points wind up around the line $\dot{v} = -.8v$. 
				p
					| The first cart below obeys the $v(t)$ function you designed. The second obeys $v(t)=2e^{-.8t}$. If you draw $v(t)$ correctly, both cars move together. Grey lines indicate  locations sampled every half-second, so if the carts move in tandem they'll line up.
