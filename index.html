            <p flex='50'>Maybe you're used to solving equations like $ t^2 - 2t = 1,$ where 'solving' means finding a <em>number</em>, $t$. By contrast, solving a differential equation involves finding an unknown <em>function</em>, which sounds weird until you do it.</p>

                <p>Consider a cart rolling to a stop: friction slows it down a lot when it goes fast, and only a little when it goes slow. </p>
                <p>It turns out friction obeys $$v' = -kv, $$ where $v$ is velocity and $k$ is a 'coefficient of friction' that depends on the cart's axels and the surface. This is a DE that says "acceleration (i.e., $v'$) is negatively proportionate to velocity." Its solution is a function $v(t)$ that gives the velocity at time $t$.</p>

        </div>
        <div class='copy'>
        </div>
        <div class='copy'>

            <p>Since this is the Internet, you'll solve this DE visually. What you'll do is drop points on the left plot to make a function $v(t)$. These points are pairs $(t, v(t))$. When you make one, the browser finds the derivative $v'(t)$, and plots the point $(v(t), v'(t))$ on the right. Your job is to draw $v(t)$ so $(v(t),v'(t))$ always winds up on the line $v' = -0.5 \cdot v$.</p>
        </div>
        <div class='copy'>
            <p>Maybe you'll notice: there are many $v(t)$'s that satisfy $v'=0.5v$, but they all have the same sort of shape. These solutions are functions of the form $$v_0 \cdot e^{-kt},$$ where $v_0$ is the starting velocity (the one at time $t=0$) and $e$ is euler's constant. You can check from your derivative rules that $$ \frac{d}{dt}(v_0 \cdot e^{-kt})= k\cdot (v_0 \cdot e^{-kt}),$$ which is what we want.</p>
