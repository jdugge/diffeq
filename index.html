      <p id='quote'>With nothing to see except a blackboard strewn with differential equations, the educated man with an informed interest in science melted away.

      <p>The phrase "differential equation" is intimidating. It sounds like a fake science word from a movie, like '<a href='http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Inverse_tachyon_pulse'>tachyon pulse</a>' or '<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeLorean_time_machine'>flux capacitor</a>.' But  <em>DE</em>'s are also among the best tools we have to design systems and make sense of nature. This piece explains</p>
      <ol>
        <li>what makes differential equations different from a regular equations</li>
        <li>how to solve a simple class of them.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>It should be readable if you've taken calc.</p>

      <h2>Derivative refresher</h2>
      <p>The derivative of a function is basically its slope. That slope can be rendered as the height of a triangle whose base is $1$ and whose hypoteneuse is tangent to $y$ at $t$. (This makes more sense when you try it out!) Below, hover over the left plot to see $y$'s derivatives, which are plotted on the right as the <em>derivative function</em> $y'(t)$.</p>

      <h2>What makes DE's different?</h2>
      <p>Maybe you're used to solving equations like $$ t^2 - 2t = 1.$$ Solving this equation means finding a value of $t$ that makes the left- and right-hand sides equal. The solution is a <em>number</em>.</p>
      <p>A differential equation, by contrast, is statement like $$ y'(t) + \lambda \cdot y(t) = 0$$ that involves the derivative of an unknown <em>function</em> $y(t)$. So we start out knowing some fact about $y$'s derivative, and we have figure out what $y$ is.</p>
    </div>
    <div class='copy'>
      <h3>Example 1: Amateur hour</h3>
      <p>Consider the differential equation $$y'(t) = .$$ You can solve this one pretty easily by just integrating it...$$\int y'(t) = ,$$ but we're going to solve it visually, since this is the Internet. Below, $t^2 + 2t +...$ is plotted on the right. To solve the DE, draw a function, $y(t)$, whose derivatives fall on $t^2 + 2t +...$.</p>

    </div>
    <div class='copy'>
      <p>Now it's time to gaze upon the man-melting power of the mother of all DE's:$$ y'(t) = .5 \cdot y(t)$$. Just try to integrate this beast away. You can't because $y(t)$ <em>is already in the equation</em>, crouched and waiting for you with a sharp knife.</p>
      <p>You'll solve this DE visually, but this time the horizontal axis of the right plot isn't $t$, it's $y$ itself. That's because the equation says, "The derivative of $y$ is always one-half of $y$ itself." So if you draw $y(t)$ correctly, its derivative will always fall on the straight line $y' = 0.5 \cdot y$.</p>
