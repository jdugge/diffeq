    <p flex="50">Maybe you're used to solving equations like $ t^2 - 2t = 1,$ where 'solving' means finding an unknown <em>number</em>, $t$. By contrast, solving a differential equation involves finding an unknown <em>function</em>.</p>

      <p>It turns out that friction leads to the DE $$v' = -k \cdot v, $$ where $v$ is velocity, $v'$ is how fast velocity is changing (i.e., acceleration) and $k$ is a 'coefficient of friction' that depends on physical details, like whether the cart's axels are greased. </p>
      <p>
         
        We'll use this DE to find a function $v(t)$ that tells us the velocity at time $t$, given that the starting velocity is $2$ and  $k=1$. That function is a solution to $$v'= -v.$$

      <p>To find $v(t)$, make and drag points on Plot A. Each point is a time/velocity pair like $\left( t, v \right)$. The program strings those $(t,v)$ together to make a function $v(t)$. You start out with the point $(t=0,v=2)$, since the velocity starts out at $2$.</p>
      <p>
         
        The slope of $v(t)$ is a derivative $v'$, so the point you draw also give us a bunch of velocity/derivative pairs that look like $\left( v, v' \right)$. Those pairs appear as points on Plot B. When you draw the right $v(t)$, the $\left(v, v' \right)$ points of Plot B will wind up on the line $v'= -v$.
