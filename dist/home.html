      With nothing to see except a blackboard strewn with differential equations, the educated man with an informed interest in science melted away.

        <p>You're probably used to equations like $$(t-.5)(t-1)= 0,$$ where 'solving' means finding an unknown <em>number</em>. A differential equation (DE), by contrast, is a fact about the derivative of an unknown <em>function</em>, and 'solving' one means finding a function that fits.</p>
        <p>To visualize derivatives, we can draw a right <span class='col tri'>triangle</span> whose hypoteneuse is tangent to a function. If the triangle's width is $1$, then its <span class='col dv'>height</span> is the derivative.</p>
        <p>Mousing over the plots to the right, you can see the derivative of <span class='col v'>$\sin(t)$</span> is <span class='col dv'>$\cos(t)$</span>. Thus, $y(t)=\sin(t)$ is a solution to $$ \dot y = \cos(t).$$ </p>
        <p>That's a pretty basic DE, though. You could have solved it just by integrating $\cos(t)$. Now let's look at a more complicated one.</p>

        <p>Here, you'll solve the cart's DE manually by picking a series of $\left( t, v \right)$ pairs, which make up the function $v(t)$. At each point, the derivative $\dot{v}$ is calculated and the corresponding pair $( v, \dot{v})$ shows up on the lower chart. If you try to draw $v(t)=2e^-{.8t}$, then the $(v, \dot {v})$ points wind up around the line $\dot{v} = -.8v$. </p>
        <p>The first cart below obeys the $v(t)$ function you designed. The second obeys $v(t)=2e^{-.8t}$. If you draw $v(t)$ correctly, both cars move together. Grey lines indicate  locations sampled every half-second, so if the carts move in tandem they'll line up.</p>
