on design scales, have only one scale for width and height
make the design plots totally squared

STRATEGY
- add the little art

add a play button
add a second cart

show the exp-t function

MED TERM
change everything to v' = 0.8\cdot v
take care of right-clicks
make a "show the answer" button
make a span/color directive
color everything
put some of the text in tooltips for further explanation
use marker arrows on the lines to point the derivative direction

SHORT TERM
install mathjax locally

ASK IAN THE DOM QUESITON ABOUT THE HEIGHT


put a texture on the background of the plots

LONG TERM
make em a bold italic, not just an italic
make a mathJAX directive and use it to place text by using the getBoundingClientRect of whatever you're pointing at (or use getBBox)
use scope.$destroy when one of the dots gets killed off
get rid of mathjs dependency
put all in-line calculations as getters
kill the lines and use the d3Der

rearrange your app.coffee so the requries are just in the directive definition
