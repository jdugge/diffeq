on design scales, have only one scale for width and height
make the design plots totally squared
break the sin/cos plots into two


put class on foreignobject stuff to stylize the mathjax 

STRATEGY
- add the little art

add a play button
add a second cart

show the exp-t function

MED TERM
have the last v extended in the cart example
change everything to v' = 0.8\cdot v
take care of right-clicks
make a "show the answer" button
make a span/color directive
color everything
use marker arrows on the lines to point the derivative direction

SHORT TERM
http://blog.datacamp.com/mathjax-binding-in-angular-js/



ASK IAN THE DOM QUESITON ABOUT THE HEIGHT


put a texture on the background of the plots

LONG TERM
put the plot titles in front of little grey things

have a ghost of the cart...light-opacity images of it sampled at regular intervals
use one of those special scales that doesn't go off the end for the foreignobject labels
put a y-axis zero line and label on the first three charts
don't just have the value light up at the top, have it snap to the zero-line
make em a bold italic, not just an italic
make a mathJAX directive and use it to place text by using the getBoundingClientRect of whatever you're pointing at (or use getBBox)
use scope.$destroy when one of the dots gets killed off
put all in-line calculations as getters
