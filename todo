RIGHT NOW
put the solution on the designA plot faint and yellow

STRATEGY
add a play button
add a second cart

MED TERM
have the last v extended in the cart example
change everything to v' = 0.8\cdot v
take care of right-clicks
make a "show the answer" button
use marker arrows on the lines to point the derivative direction

SHORT TERM

LONG TERM
add scroll to zoom on the y-axis of the designA chart
just use a fixed height for everything
add a optional transition duration on the axes
download the fonts
put the plot titles in front of little grey things
have a ghost of the cart...light-opacity images of it sampled at regular intervals
use one of those special scales that doesn't go off the end for the foreignobject labels
don't just have the value light up at the top, have it snap to the zero-line
make em a bold italic, not just an italic
make a mathJAX directive and use it to place text by using the getBoundingClientRect of whatever you're pointing at (or use getBBox)
use scope.$destroy when one of the dots gets killed off
put all in-line calculations as getters
use common classes to simplify controllers
use my own slider
animate the triangle in and out of existence
put transitions on a lot more things


UNIFYING CLASSES
changes @V and @T to @VER and @HOR
